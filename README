# --------------- Brief summary of what this sofware does --------------------------
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The current program is an implementation of the knowledge-based free energy functions
# described in the following publication:-

# Sankar K et al. (2017) Knowledge-based entropies improve the identification of native 
# protein structures. PNAS 114(11):2928-2933.
#  
# It takes as input a set of protein structure files in PDB format and returns a set of
# excel files containing the results of running the KBF calculations.

# ========================= INSTALLATON INSTRUCTIONS ========================= 


1. Install MATLAB Runtime (MCR) verison 2015b (It is important to use this verison) for 
   Linux 64-bit: https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html

2. Set the environmental variable LD_LIRARY_PATH to the location where MCR is installed.
   By default the location is '/usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Runtime/v90'. 
   So then it would be (set it in .basrc/.bash_profile itself):-

	> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Runtime/v90
	
3. Download the source code folder 'kbf'. All computations should be performed in this 
   folder.


# ========================= KBF CALCULATION ========================= 

In order to calculate KBF for a set of structure(s):-

1. Go into the 'kbf folder.
   > cd </path/to/kbf/folder/>
   
2. In the 'kbf' folder, clean any previous runs' files by running clean.sh
    > sh clean.sh

3. Copy the PDB files (that you need to compute KBF on) into the 'kbf' folder 
   (do not place it in  any subfolders).

4. Go into the 'kbf' folder & simply execute kbf_linux.sh and O/P files will be generated.
   > sh kbf_linux.sh
